## Tutorial

👉 **[Hetereogeneous Converged AI Resource Management]({{ site.baseurl }}/conference-activities/eurosys-2026/LLM-LA/)**  
This tutorial introduces the new AI resource management framework that is able to manage heterogeneous AI workload dynamics at both low and high resource pressure by doing reverse Join-Idle-Queue load-balancing, coupled autoscaling and fast model switching. The purpose is to enable attendees to use our framework and get them to try it.

👉 **[TrIO: Flat and Collective I/O for Container]({{ site.baseurl }}/conference-activities/eurosys-2026/TrIO/)**  
This tutorial aims to dissect the underlying causes of I/O bottleneck and introduce TrIO, an open-source I/O accelerator for container

👉 **[The Intelligent Core of openEuler: Witty (Eulercopilot)]({{ site.baseurl }}/conference-activities/eurosys-2026/Witty/)**  
This tutorial focuses on the integration of openEuler with foundation models, and introduces the application of Witty, as the core of openEuler intelligence, in system O&M and development scenarios.

👉 **[Systematic Analysis of the openYuanrong Distributed Computing Engine]({{ site.baseurl }}/conference-activities/eurosys-2026/openYuanrong/)**  
This tutorial will introduce the openYuanrong distributed computing engine. openYuanrong is dedicated to building a set of serverless architecture distributed applications. It provides a multi-language function programming interface, simplifying distributed application development with a single-machine programming experience. It also offers capabilities such as distributed dynamic scheduling and data sharing, enabling high-performance operation of distributed applications and efficient resource utilization in clusters.

👉 **[AgentEye - Enabling OpenYuanrong to run Agentic AI Workload]({{ site.baseurl }}/conference-activities/eurosys-2026/AgentEye/)**  
This tutorial will introduce the AgentEye technology which is implemented on top of OpenYuanrong and explain how this technology benefit different schedulers to better run AI Agents on the underlying infrastructure. The objective is to explore potential collaboration projects with academics interested in Agentic AI workload by demonstrating this state-of-the-art technology.
