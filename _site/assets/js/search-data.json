    "content": "AI workloads are rapidly reshaping system design assumptions, exposing limitations in resource management, data paths, distributed execution, and observability that were not built for large-scale, heterogeneous, and latency-sensitive AI environments. This tutorial highlights cross-layer design across kernel, runtime, and distributed layers to support AI-native workloads. The tutorial is structured around two complementary tracks: Systems for AI and AI for Systems. The former focuses on heterogeneous resource management, distributed runtimes, and container-oriented data-path optimization to improve efficiency and scalability of AI execution. The latter explores how AI enhances system intelligence through observability, agent-aware scheduling, and large-model integration into system development and operational workflows. 📅 EVENT DATE &amp; TIME .
